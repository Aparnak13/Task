In this SQL project, I designed and implemented a simplified model of a pharmaceutical supply chain system. I began by defining core entities such as Manufacturers, Distributors, Pharmacies, Suppliers, Customers, and Products, using CREATE TABLE statements with relevant foreign keys to maintain data integrity. I then created supporting tables like Orders, Shipments, and Inventory to simulate the movement of pharmaceutical products between different entities in the supply chain. Sample data was inserted into each table to represent real-world scenarios, such as pharmacies placing orders to distributors, shipments being made with batch numbers and expiry dates, and inventory updates reflecting the received goods. Finally, I wrote several queries to retrieve meaningful information from the systemâ€”for example, displaying pharmacy inventory, completed orders, all shipment records, and a list of suppliers and customers. This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to manage and track pharmaceutical logistics efficiently.
